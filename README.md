# Path Evolved Antenna
2-dimensional patch antenna optimized with genetic algorithms.

##Â Objectives
The main goal of this project is simulating the evolution of a patch antenna subject to space and shape constraints, in order to maximize isotropic gain and minimize backlobes propagation. The simulation is carried out through a genetic algorithm framed as described in the following paragraphs.

### Problem representation

### Constraints

### Fitness (objective function)

### Crossover and mutation
